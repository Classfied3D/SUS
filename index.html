      So here's what happened so far:
      <li>Minecraft was killed by Roblox
      <li>Roblox was ejected by Fortnite
      <li>Fortnite got kicked because they broke the server rules
      <li>Among us ruled and then everyone left because boring except the hackers until the hackers were bored playing with other hackers (A crewmate killed a imposter from the other side of the map and the imposter just revived themself)
      <li>And Fall Guys manged to kill themselves before the game even started
      <br><br>
      But the question is: what idiots made this site?
      <br>
      And the answer is that the website is not sus.
      <br>
      And the comment is: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
      <br>
      And the comment to the comment is: You seem to be a bit sus yourself
